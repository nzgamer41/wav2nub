# wav2nub
Converts wav files to Namco's NUB format. Still a WIP, was previously called snd2nub for adding the header only to raw snd files made by something like GoldWave.

## Features:
Will convert any 44.1khz 16bit stereo WAV file into a NUB file with a valid header.

## WIP:
- Figuring out how looping works in the header so we can loop the track properly
- Specifying a bitrate for replacing WM2 tracks if people want to
- GUI?

### Thanks:
RiZe and Dax on the WM Emulation Discord for helping me with finding some info on the NUB headers
